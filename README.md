# MarathonSchedule

This senior project was made to satisfy the IB SL Computer Science requirements for the IB program. Project involved interviewing a client and developing a program addressing clients needs. My client was an avid runner looking for a custom marathon training schedule.

- Java program generates custom marathon training schedule for user. 
- The program is be based on a generic training schedule with at least one longer run, tempo run or workout, and easy run each week before the last two weeks of tapering.
- To provide flexibility, user can adjust mileage each day. Program will revaluate and adjust mileage for reaminder of week, to allow user ability to still meet target mileage for week.
